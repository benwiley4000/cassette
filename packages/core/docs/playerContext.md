| registerVideoHostElement      | A function which registers a DOM element as eligible to host the video content. Generally it's a better idea to use the [`VideoDisplay`](#videodisplay) component, which uses this internally.                                 |
| renderVideoIntoHostElement      | A function which moves the video content into the given host DOM element. `registerVideoHostElement` must be called first.                                 |
| unregisterVideoHostElement      | A function which unregisters a DOM element that has been used to host the video content. This should **always** be called before the container is removed from the DOM.                                 |
| onTogglePause                | A function which can be called with no arguments to toggle the `paused` state, or with a boolean argument to set the `paused` value directly.                                                                              |

| onForwardSkip                | A function which can be called to trigger a forward skip                                                                                                                                                                   |
| onSeekPreview                | A function which should be called as the seek time is updated using a progress slider UI, with the new time value as an argument (the resulting behavior depends on the `seekMode` prop passed to [`PlayerContextProvider`](#playercontextprovider)). **`onSeekComplete` must be called when time updates are finished.** If the seeking UI involves a discrete click/tap only, then simply call `onSeekComplete` with the desired seek time. |
| onSeekComplete               | A function which should be called in two scenarios: 1. When a time seek has completed (the user has released the mouse), it should be called with **no arguments** to seek to the last time value provided to `onSeekPreview`. Don't forget this! 2. It can be called with a **number argument** that specifies a time to seek to immediately (no need to call `onSeekPreview` first). |
| onSetVolume                  | A function which should be called as volume adjustments are made using a volume slider UI, with the new volume as an argument. **`onSetVolumeComplete` must be called when adjustments are finished.** If the volume UI involves a discrete click/tap only, then simply call `onSetVolumeComplete` with the desired volume. |
| onSetVolumeComplete          | A function which should be called in two scenarios: 1. When a volume update has completed (the user has released the mouse), it should be called with **no arguments** to commit the current volume (the last one set with `onSetVolume`) as stable. Don't forget this! 2. It can be called with a **number argument** that specifies a new volume to set immediately (no need to call `onSetVolume` first). |
| onToggleMuted                | A function which can be called with no arguments to toggle the `muted` state, or with a boolean argument to set the `muted` value directly.                                                                                |
| onToggleShuffle              | A function which can be called with no arguments to toggle the `shuffle` state, or with a boolean argument to set the `shuffle` value directly.                                                                            |
| onSetRepeatStrategy          | A function which can be called with a new `repeatStrategy` to use                                                                                                                                                          |
| onSetPlaybackRate            | A function which can be called with a new `playbackRate` to use                                                                                                                                                            |
