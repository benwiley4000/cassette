In order to use the default stylings you'll need to grab the compiled `cassette-player.css` sheet from the `@cassette/player` module's `dist/` directory. Using webpack with appropriate style loaders, you can do:

```js static
import '@cassette/player/dist/css/cassette-player.css';
```

Again, if you're not using npm, you can get the sheet [here](https://github.com/benwiley4000/cassette/releases).
